# Chess - CMPM 123 - Noah Baron

Current implementation for this project has a setup chessboard based on FEN strings, and move generation and captures for pawns, knights, and bishops. The move generation is based on runtime compiled bitboards, using preset move calculations, and then testing to see if those moves are available for the user to make. 

This was developed on Windows 10.
